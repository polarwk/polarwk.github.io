**Bitcoin Ransomware Address Detection:** This paper proposes a ransomware address detection method based on Bitcoin transaction relationships:
1. Proposed a cascade feature extraction method for Bitcoin UTXOs to accurately model ransomware activities.
2. Constructed a ransomware address detection model using the PU-Bagging method, solving the data imbalance problem where ransomware addresses account for only 0.002% of the total Bitcoin volume.

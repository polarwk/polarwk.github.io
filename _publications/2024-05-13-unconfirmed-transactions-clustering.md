**Bitcoin Address Clustering:** This paper proposes a new method to improve clustering effectiveness using memory pool data:
1. Modified Bitcoin node source code to collect and analyze unconfirmed transactions located in the Bitcoin memory pool.
2. Designed two new clustering heuristics, advancing a critical issue in Bitcoin regulation: de-anonymization.
3. Proposed a method for constructing a labeled dataset to verify clustering results. Experimental results show our method tripled the recall rate.

**Bitcoin Transaction De-anonymization:** This paper proposes a Bitcoin transaction traceability method based on Bitcoin network traffic analysis:
1. Based on the characteristics of the physical network relied upon by the Bitcoin network, probe nodes were built to collect Bitcoin network traffic.
2. Analyzed the collected network traffic data to achieve traceability of Bitcoin transaction input addresses, and tested the scheme in a distributed Bitcoin network environment.
3. Experimental results show that this traceability mechanism is applicable to nodes connected to the Bitcoin network (excluding VPN, Tor, etc.), achieving a 47.5% recall rate and 70.4% accuracy rate, showing great promise in practice.

**Large-scale Empirical Analysis of Ransomware Activities:** This paper proposes an industry identification method and uses it to analyze ransomware activities in Bitcoin:
1. Proposed new Bitcoin address clustering heuristics for peel chain transactions and lock-time transactions.
2. Based on address clustering, proposed a user industry identity identification method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to determine the purpose of user activities.
3. Analyzed the illegal fund flows of ransomware activities and the activities of victims from an industry perspective.

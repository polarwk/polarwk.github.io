**BFT Consensus Protocol Security Testing Framework:** This paper proposes an automated security testing framework for BFT protocols called BFTDiagnosis:
1. The framework can automatically configure and launch protocol testing tasks and build consensus nodes to execute different BFT protocols.
2. During testing, consensus nodes can inject malicious behaviors based on pattern matching strategies and malicious behavior trigger mechanisms to simulate various malicious scenarios.
3. Through an analyzer, BFTDiagnosis can collect protocol runtime data from consensus nodes and calculate four security quantification metrics to evaluate protocol performance.

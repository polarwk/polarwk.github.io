I received my B.E. degree from the School of Software at Fudan University in 2020. Subsequently, I obtained my Ph.D. from Fudan University in 2025, under the supervision of [Dr. WeiLi Han] (https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/weili/zh_CN/index.htm).

My research interests are centered on the security and scalability of decentralized networks. I have a strong focus on Blockchain Data Analysis, utilizing graph theory and machine learning to interpret complex on-chain behaviors.

Concurrently, I am investigating Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocols, aiming to solve the island effect of current blockchains by designing mechanisms that ensure seamless and trustless communication between different chains.
